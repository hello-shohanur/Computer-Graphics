# Computer Graphics Lab 
Assalamu Alaikum (السلام عليكم). This repository contains all of the Computer Graphics lab projects that have already been completed in lab class. The entire project is written in C++. Use OpenGL libraries to make UI animations more responsive, manage embedded videos, and render vector graphics in 2D and 3D visuals.

# Input & Output
I used Codeblocks for completing all the projects. Download the Codeblocks and the OpenGL libraries setup files from the above Installation folder.

## Using system: 
1. Download the repository as a zip file then extract it.
2. Open the Installation folder and install the Codeblocks by clicking on the 'exe' file (Version: 10.05). 
3. Extract the 'glut-3.7.6-bin.rar' file and open it. 
4. Now copy the 'glut32.dll' file and paste it to:
open the 'C' drive, then open the 'Windows' folder, then open the 'SysWOW64' folder, now paste it here. (For 64-bit windows)
open the 'C' drive, then open the 'Windows' folder, then open the 'System32' folder, now paste it here. (For 32-bit windows)
5. Now copy the 'glut32.lib' file and paste it to:
open the 'C' drive, then open the 'Program Files(x86)' folder, then open the 'CodeBlocks' folder, then open the 'minGW' folder, then open the 'lib' folder, now paste here.
6. Now copy the 'glut.h' file and paste it to:
open the 'C' drive, then open the 'Program Files(x86)' folder, then open the 'CodeBlocks' folder, then open the 'minGW' folder, then open the 'include' folder, then open the 'GL' folder, now paste here.
7. After these, open the Codeblocks and click on the 'File' option from the top left corner. Then, keep the cursor on 'New' and click on 'Project'. Now click on the 'GLUT project' and press the 'Go' button. Then, select a name and press 'Next'. Paste the GLUT's location as 'C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW' and press 'next' and then press the 'finish' button. 
8. Now click on the 'Settings' button from the top. Then click on the 'Compiler and debugger' option. Then click on 'Toolchain executables' and press the 'Auto detect' button. If it doesn't work, then paste 'C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW' there. and press the 'ok' button below.
9. All setup is done. Now, double-click on the 'Source' file and click on the 'main.cpp' file. Now remove the default code and paste the specific lab code.
